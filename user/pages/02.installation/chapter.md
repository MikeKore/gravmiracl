#Installation

This section describes how you can install and deploy M-Pin Core. The information applies to both Free-Tier and Enterprise-Tier installations. It covers switching from the Free-Tier to the Enterprise-Tier infrastructure of M-Pin Core.

>>>>>The Free-Tier product version is not available through some distribution channels, like AWS. These channels offer a free trial of the Enterprise-Tier version instead.
